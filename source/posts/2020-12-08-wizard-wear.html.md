In thie dream, I was walking in a neighborhood with tall, thick trees lining the street. Their leaves blocked out a lot of the sun, hard to tell what time of day it was. I walked past a house that had things in front. On a little table, there was a water bowl for a reptile and a small wax lined cardboard box with a tadpole inside. It was nearly a frog. It had legs, but still had a tail. I excitedly took these two things. 

I was excited about rasing a frog.

I would have to get an aquarium. What do frogs like? Should it be mostly land or mostly water? I should probably get some lily pads! That would mean it would be partially water, and the aquarium would have to be huge! I could get little fish that could swim beneath the lily pads. I could feed my frog the flies that came into the house. These were my thoughts as I was walking home.

I opened the door to my house and along the wall was a mounted aquarium spanning the entire length of the wall. The top one was filled with fish, swimming along in clusters, aquatic plants moving gently. The aquarium beneath it was empty. I was so excited! I was ready for this!

In another part of my dream, I was attending some sort of church service where I ran into my brother. He was wearing a beautiful green robe with gold buttons and light green trim. I asked him where he got his outfit and he pointed to a cardboard box, filled with these robes. I shuffled through each garment, checking the tags to see if there was one in S or XS. As I was looking, my cousin, Carol came up to me and told me they also had magenta robes. Implying these are for women. Ignoring her, I found one my size and noticed another box filled with matching santa hats. I looked for one that would fit and found a coupon sheet for a pet store specializing in aquatic pets. It was shiny.
