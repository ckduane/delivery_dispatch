I was in a food court with my family. I noticed another family pointing and laughing at us. They were wearing blue and pink rain jackets. My family was also wearing the same blue and pink rain jackets. I looked back at them and gave them a friendly chuckle. Oh isn't it funny how we are all wearing the same things? Must have been a great deal! I looked around and everyone in the food court was wearing the same jackets. I looked at myself and I was wearing a green jacket.
