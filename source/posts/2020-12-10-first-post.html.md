Last night I dreamt that I was in a beachy town wanting to go swimming. I was on the shore. The water was surging, a calm deep blue. The waves were getting higher and higher, surpassing the size of the houses on the cliffs. I was staring at it, ready to swim out, and be taken by the tides.

As I was walking towards the water, people around me were scrambling to collect their belongings from the beach. They asked me to help them and I did. I grabbed pillows, picnic baskets, and ran with them down a cobblestone pathway.

A couple was rushing back to their apartment. I kept wanting to go back into the water. Their apartment was a faded pastel pink, peeling paint over wooden panels. Posters on the wall, some spray paint here and there. Two men with near uni-brows, one had a beard with no mustache, the other, a mustache with thin sideburns. Both were wearing clothing appropriate for the beach. I noticed their curled body hairs. They were clearly in love. Their makeup were patches of colorful magenta, turquoise, highlighting their eyelids and cheeks, in asymmetry. Their apartment was small. A mattress was in their living room. I was keeping one company while the other was busy in the kitchen. They were talking lovingly to each other and laughing.
